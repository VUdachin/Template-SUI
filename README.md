## About
The project is the starting point of your new iOS application. It takes over the work of writing such popular scripts as authorization, user profile, home screen with different UI elements and much more.
All you have to do is to connect your backend service to make it work, or use a ready-made version from Firebase, which will also be customized for your needs.

## Roadmap:
- [ ] Make basic scenarios - main, profile, authorization
- [ ] Integrate Firebase into existing scenarios
- [ ] Make basic documentation on project customization
- [ ] MacOS App for custom project configuration
- [ ] Integrate other backend systems

### Written in SwiftUI, iOS 17
